## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd comfy-fs

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH (optional)
cp target/release/comfy-fs /usr/local/bin/
```

### First-Time Setup

When you run `comfy-fs` for the first time, it will guide you through the configuration:

```bash
$ comfy-fs list /

Let's configure your connection settings:

Server IP address: 192.168.8.156
Username: comfy
Password: ****
Preferred protocol (1=SMB, 2=FTP) [default: 1]: 1

✅ Configuration complete!
```

To reconfigure later, run:
```bash
comfy-fs config
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

**List files on the server:**
```bash
comfy-fs list /
comfy-fs list /documents --sort name --reverse
```

**Browse files interactively:**
```bash
comfy-fs browse
comfy-fs browse /documents
```

**Download files:**
```bash
# Single file
comfy-fs download /path/to/file.pdf ./downloads/

# Multiple files with wildcards
comfy-fs download "/documents/*.pdf" ./downloads/
comfy-fs download "/reports/2024*" ./reports/
```

**Upload files:**
```bash
# Single file
comfy-fs upload document.pdf --dest /documents/

# Multiple files
comfy-fs upload *.jpg report.pdf --dest /uploads/
```

**Synchronize directories:**
```bash
# Two-way sync between local and remote
comfy-fs sync ./local-folder /remote-folder
```

**Interactive mode:**
```bash
comfy-fs interactive
# or just
comfy-fs
```

### Advanced Usage

**Configure different servers:**
```bash
comfy-fs config --server 192.168.1.100 --username user2
```

**Sort file listings:**
```bash
comfy-fs list / --sort modified     # by date (default)
comfy-fs list / --sort name         # alphabetically
comfy-fs list / --sort size         # by file size
comfy-fs list / --sort type         # by file type
comfy-fs list / --reverse           # reverse sort order
```

**Wildcard patterns:**
- `*` - matches everything
- `*.ext` - files with specific extension
- `prefix*` - files starting with prefix
- `*suffix` - files ending with suffix

## Interactive TUI

The interactive mode provides a full-screen file browser with:

- **Arrow keys**: Navigate files and directories
- **Enter**: Enter directories or download files
- **Backspace**: Go up one directory
- **Space**: Toggle file selection
- **Tab**: Change sort mode (modified → name → size → type)
- **d**: Download selected files
- **q**: Quit

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- Cargo

### Building

# Development build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Lint code
make lint

# All quality checks

```

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: 25 tests covering all modules
- **Integration Tests**: 20 tests covering CLI functionality
- **Mock Tests**: Using mockall for isolated testing
- **Total Coverage**: 45+ tests ensuring reliability

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test integration_test
cargo test --test upload_download_test

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in your system's config directory:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/comfy-fs/config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.comfy.comfy-fs/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\comfy\comfy-fs\config.json`

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "server_ip": "192.168.8.156",
  "username": "comfy",
  "default_protocol": "Ftp"
}
```

Note: Passwords are not stored in the config file for security reasons.

## Performance

- **Parallel Downloads**: Up to 4 concurrent connections by default
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming file transfers
- **Fast TUI**: 60fps responsive interface
- **Minimal Overhead**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions

### Benchmarks

On a 2.5GbE connection:
- Single file download: ~250MB/s
- Parallel downloads: ~240MB/s aggregate
- File listing: <100ms for 1000 files

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
comfy-fs list /

# Check configuration
comfy-fs config

# Verify server credentials in docs/
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check available bandwidth
# Ethernet: up to 250MB/s (2.5GbE)
# WiFi: varies by network

# For better performance, use ethernet with 2.5GbE dongles
```

### Common Errors

**"Failed to connect"**: Check network connection and server IP
**"Authentication failed"**: Verify username and password
**"Permission denied"**: Check file/directory permissions on server
**"File not found"**: Verify the remote path exists
